This program is designed to read in multiple csv files from Spotify charts the ones I chose are from the viral 50 chart from the weeks of September 3rd and October 8th of this year. Using the csv files the program takes on the task of receiving all the songs that appear and creates an array of the song titles. With the array of song titles the program then displays the songs to the user asking him to choose a start and end to his playlist based on position creating a subset of all the songs. Then with the start and end position number the program implements a binary search tree using the song title as a key to create a playlist that is then printed to an output file. In the output example of this program the selected positions were 20 and 65 creating a 45 song playlist.


**Installation**

If you wish to compile my program I would recommend using an IDE with Java 8 because that is what I used to create the program and from there you can simply paste the code into the IDE. To get a csv file you can go to Spotify Charts or use the one provided in the Data folder.

**Dependencies**

* Java 8

**Folder Structure**

* Main Code in src folder
* Input text file in Data folder
* Output in output folder
