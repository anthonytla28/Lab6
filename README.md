# Lab6

By: Anthony Tlatenchi

This program is designed to be used as a grading calculator speccifically created based on the outline of my data structure class and it's syllabus. The program uses a java Graphical User Interface or GUI for short. When you run the program the GUI window will open up and inside you will be able to enter your grade for each category using sliders after entering the grade you then press the sum button and it will return the total and your overall grade for the class. In order to see your letter grade you will have to compare the number grade to the syllabus of the class.  


**Installation**

If you wish to compile my program I would recommend using an IDE with Java 8 because that is what I used to create the program and from there you can simply paste the code into the IDE. 
**Dependencies**

* Java 8

**Folder Structure**

* Main Code in src folder
* Syllabus in class folder
